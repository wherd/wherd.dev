Modern software has become increasingly bloated, consuming gigabytes of RAM for simple tasks. I build tools that challenge this trend &mdash; small, fast applications that run in your terminal and get out of your way.

Each project follows the Unix philosophy: do one thing and do it well. These tools are designed to be daily drivers that you'll actually want to use.
